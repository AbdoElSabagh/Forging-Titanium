Hey everybody! Thanks for checking out this screencast. In this week's episode of Forging Titanium we'll be integrating the Date.js library into a Titanium app. If you can't guess by the name, Date.js's primary objective is to add loads of convenience and functionality to the native Javascript Date object. By taking a look at the Date.js website, we can quickly see that its syntax is meant to be very clear and expressive. This is achieved primarily through Date.js's improved date string parser. As Javascript developers well know, formatting dates to be used by the Date object can be a troublesome tasks at times, especially when considering the multitude of sources and formats with which a date can be received.Here in the getting started guide we see a good example of the more robust parser in action. The Date.parse function, added by the Date.js library, allows the Javascript Date object to handle far more date string values and formats than it ever could before. You'll note in this guide, and in the expansive API documentation, that Date.js also offers many additional functions for modification, formatting, and comparison.While it's _really_ fun to sit and read documentation about date formatting all day long, why don't we move on to applying the power of this library to a Titanium app. To do this, we'll obviously first have to download the library itself.On the download page, we have 2 choices. For the sake of this screencast, we'll just be downloading the date.js file and including it in our Titanium test project. This gives us everything we need to handle dates in the standard English US format. If we wanted to support one or more of the 150 culture-specific versions Date.js has made available, we would download the zip file on this page, which includes Javascript files for each. With the date.js file downloaded, let's open up Titanium Studio and take a look at the cross platform app we've created with it.
