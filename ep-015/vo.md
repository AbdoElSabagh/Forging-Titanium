Hello and welcome to another episode of Forging Titanium. Today is part 2 in the 3 part Twisti app series. In part one we saw how we can create a native Android module to leverage additional sensor data and native processing performance to determine the physical orientation of an Android device. In this screencast we're going to use this data to render a 3 dimensional representation of Android devices. To do so, we'll use the open source 3D Javascript engine, Three.js, along with the &lt;canvas&gt; element in a Titanium WebView. It's the best of both worlds: powerful platform specific functionality and performance combined with open compatibility of web-based rendering.
