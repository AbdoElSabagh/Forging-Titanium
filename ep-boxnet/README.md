## Forging Titanium Episode XX: Box Module for Cloud Storage**Editors note: This and future episodes of Forging Titanium are available [here](http://vimeopro.com/appcelerator/forging-titanium).**[Box](http://box.com) is a cloud storage solution that caters to individuals and companies alike. Why are we talking about it in Forging Titanium? Well, because along with great end user functionality, Box also comes with a robust developer API for both Android and iOS. And guess what? There's a Titanium module for both platforms available in the Appcelerator Open Mobile Marketplace.What's even better is that in conjunction with Box we are having a contest to see who can make the best Titanium app using this module. Details on the contest can be found here: [LINK TO CONTEST]()This episode of Forging Titanium will give you an overview of what Box is and how you can integrate into your own apps using the Box Titanium module. We'll walk through getting your Box account set up, getting API keys, and then integrating Box's SDK into your own app via the Titanium module. Everything you'll need to get ready to take on the competition in the contest. Good luck to all!### Episode Resources:* [Forging Titanium ep-boxnet github repository](https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/Forging-Titanium/tree/master/ep-boxnet)* [Box module in Appcelerator Open Mobile Marketplace](https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/793)* [Box contest details]()
