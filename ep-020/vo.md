Hey everybody! Welcome to another episode of Forging Titanium. Today we'll be talking about the 1.8 release of the Titanium Mobile SDK. While a few of you may be content to just hear me talk about it, I'm sure the rest of you want to get your hands on it. There's a link in the accompanying blog post for getting yourself set up with both Titanium Mobile 1.8 and Titanium Studio 1.0.7.In 1.8 there's a strong focus on increasing the performance and parity of the Titanium SDK. Our team took some huge steps in that direction with this release, so let's dig into a few of them now.### V8/Rhino demo ###* Massive improvements in terms of performance on Android* Show wiki speed tests* Kept rhino for legacy code/devices that do not support V8 (less than Android 2.2)* configurable in TiStudio 1.0.7**LIVE DEMO:**Show a quick comparison of the speed_v8 app against both runtimes. Mention the previously recorded episode 17### Mobile Web BETA demo ###* Deploy familiar Titanium code to HTML5 compatible web browsers* Now integrated in 1.8**LIVE DEMO:** Show how to create the basic 2 tabbed app with TiStudio 1.0.7. Show for ios, android, and browsers.### Longpress & Pinch demo ###* No more workarounds for longpress, works on both platforms* pinch is currently ios only* Documentation will be made available in the API docs upon 1.8's release**LIVE DEMO:** Demo the test_longpress_pinch app and show the simple code necessary to grab these values### Embeddable Android VideoPlayer demo ###* big parity issue solved* could only view fullscreen in android before* Now you can make videoplayers part of your view hierarchy, just like ios**LIVE DEMO:** demo the test_videoplayer app, emphasizing that identical code is now used for both android and ios### Back to script ###Along with these cool new features and parity alignments, there were a ton of other fixes and improvements. We've also dramatically improved XML DOM Level 2 support for your XML handling. This specification is now fully supported on both Android and iOS. In addition, we've kept our eye on important platform specific features. iOS 5.0.1 introduced a new file attribute that allows you to prevent files from being backed up to iCloud or iTunes. Titanium now supports that attribute through our `Titanium.Filesystem.File.remoteBackup` property. So you now have full control over how your filesystem is backed up in your iOS apps.The end goal of 1.8 is for Titanium developers to have a higher quality development experience on _all_ the platforms we support. We're aiming to deliver that through careful attention to performance and parity. We intend to maintain this focus through all our future releases as well.Thanks for checking out this episode of Forging Titanium! See ya next time!
