Hey everybody! Thanks for checking out this screencast. In this week's episode of Forging Titanium we'll be looking at how we can use the Javascript library underscore.js in our Titanium apps.In its own words, Underscore is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides a lot of the functional programming support that you would expect in Prototype.js, but without extending any of the built-in JavaScript objects. If that doesn't give you a clear enough picture of what Underscore can do, just think of it as jQuery without the DOM. It includes functions for templating, type checking, aggregation, and most notably manipulation of arrays, objects and functions.So obviously the first thing we need to do is go download underscore.js. Enter the URL <https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/> into your web browser... then click on the underscore.js file. Now download the file to your computer from the "raw" link. Typically we'd just download the packaged version available on the main underscore.js website, but at the time of this episode, we need the absolute latest version. That's because yesterday we submitted a patch to the underscore.js project so that it would support being loaded as a CommonJS module in Titanium. Big thanks goes out to Jeremy Ashkenas for the quick turn around on merging this feature.
