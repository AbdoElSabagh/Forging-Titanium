Hey everybody! Welcome to the 3rd and final part of the Twisti app series. In part 1 we created a native Android module that leveraged the accelerometer, magnetic field, and 3D calculations to determine the physical orientation of a mobile device. In part 2 we used that data to render an animated, 3 dimensional representation of the device in a WebView canvas using Three.js. Today, we are going to create a _sensor proxy_, sending its physical orientation data to multiple clients, in realtime, via sockets.I know what you're thinking, surely a series this epic should be narrated by the likes of Morgan Freeman. I agree with you whole-heartedly, but due to some scheduling conflicts you're stuck with me. Mr. Freeman sends his warmest regards and is due to be publishing his first Titanium app any day now... unless, of course, another scheduling conflict arises.
