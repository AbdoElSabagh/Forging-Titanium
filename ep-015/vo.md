Hello and welcome to another episode of Forging Titanium. Today is part 2 in the 3 part Twisti app series. In part one we saw how we can create a native Android module to leverage additional sensor data, and native processing performance, to determine the physical orientation of an Android device. If you missed part 1, I highly suggest checking it out before digging into this episode. We'll be picking up right where we left off last time. In _this_ screencast, we're going to use that sensor data to render a 3 dimensional representation of Android devices. To do so, we'll use the open source 3D Javascript engine, Three.js, along with the &lt;canvas&gt; element in a Titanium WebView. It's the best of both worlds: powerful platform specific functionality and native performance combined with the open compatibility of web-based rendering.In case you missed the sneak peek in last week's episode, let's take a quick look at what Twisti looked like last week, and what we are going to do with it today...### LIVE VIDEO ###So while this stuff looks really cool, I'm betting at least a few people watching are a little intimidated by the idea of doing their own 3D rendering and animation. But don't worry, we have Three.js to make the topic _much_ more accessible. This library has abstracted away all the gritty details of 3D rendering and leaves us with a simple Javascript API to manage. Something you Titanium developers should be very familiar with by now.
