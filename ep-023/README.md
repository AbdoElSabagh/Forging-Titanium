[David Bankier](https://twitter.com/#!/davidbankier) is the creator of [TiShadow](https://github.com/dbankier/TiShadow), a client-server application built with the intention of rapidly deploying and testing Titanium apps on multiple devices. It's inspiration comes from Adobe's new labs product, not suprisingly named [Shadow](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/shadow/).Increasing my development iteration speed is always a primary focus for me. A tool like TiShadow could be tremendous in that respect. Without further ado, I'll let David show you exactly how TiShadow could change the way you develop with Titanium.### Episode Resources:* [Forging Titanium ep-023 github repository](https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/Forging-Titanium/tree/master/ep-023)* [TiShadow on Github](https://github.com/dbankier/TiShadow)* [David Bankier's blog](http://yydigital.com/blog)
